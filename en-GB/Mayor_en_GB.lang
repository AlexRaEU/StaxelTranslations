staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10000100=Now that I think about it, I haven't properly introduced myself.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10000200=I'm the mayor of this little town.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10001300=Oh, is that your Farm Registration Letter?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10001400=How nice! Let me just take that off you for filing.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10001500=In return, you get your license and some very handy items!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10001600=Do you want to turn in your Registration Letter?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10001700=Yes, please!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10001800=No, not just yet
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10001900=Marvellous! Here is your license.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10002000=We also have a few extras for you.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10002100=We're all looking forward to seeing the farm revitalised!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10002200=As you wish!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10002300=You can still turn it in later if you change your mind!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10002400=I imagine I'll be seeing you quite often!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10002500=Now that you're a fully licensed farmer...
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10002600=We can finally get those stray cattle off our hands!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10002700=But before we can do that, you need to build a barn.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10002800=This is a Barn Sign.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10002900=Place it in front of where you want to build the barn.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10003000=You can use it to see what's missing as you build.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10003100=Once it's done, it'll activate the building!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10003200=Come and see me after that and we'll get you some cows!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10003300=How are you faring at building that barn?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10003400=Place the sign in front of where you want to build the barn.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10003500=You can use it to see what's missing as you build.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10003600=Once it's done, it'll activate the building!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10003700=Come and see me after that to get your cattle!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10003800=I've been hearing about the fabulous new barn you built!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10003900=Sounds like everything is in order.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10004000=Here are the few cows we managed to round up.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10004100=They all ran away when the previous owner left.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10004200=Good luck!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10004300=By the way, we've been looking for good builders for a long time.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10004400=Sometimes we get notices from people who want to move in here.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10004500=Before that, they need a house to live in.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10004600=Given your impressive work on the barn, we'd love your help!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10004700=Come check in with me every once in a while!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10004800=Looks like someone new wants to move in!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10004900=Stick this postbox somewhere and use it to build a house!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10005000=Once it's built, they'll move in the next day!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10005100=Hmm...
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10005200=What happened to your {0-ttm}?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mayor.line:10005300=Make sure you use it to build our future resident a home!
